HOW TO PLAY: 
A word has been randomly selected and it's your job to figure out what it is!
The number of "_" tells you how many letters are in the word.
Guess letters one at a time to reveal the secret word.
If you guess correctly, the letter will be shown in the position where it occurs in the word.
For each incorrect guess, an additional part of the hangman is drawn.
If you guess incorrectly 7 times, you will have completed the hangman and you lose the game.
